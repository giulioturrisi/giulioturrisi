### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My research interests are mainly focused on the combination of machine learning methods with classical control techniques in robotics.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2016 from the University of Pisa, and then in 2018 I graduated in the Master of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Rome, La Sapienza. Since the first year of my masterâ€™s study I was involved in the Robocup@atWork competition, working on an omnidirectional mobile robot. I started my PhD studies in October 2018 joining the DIAG Robotics Lab at La Sapienza, under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Oriolo.
