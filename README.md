I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2016 from the University of Pisa, and then in 2018 I graduated in the Master of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Rome, La Sapienza. Since the first year of my masterâ€™s study I was involved in the Robocup@atWork competition, working on an omnidirectional mobile robot. I started my PhD studies in October 2018 joining the DIAG Robotics Lab at La Sapienza, under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Oriolo.

My research interests are mainly focused on the combination of machine learning methods with classical control techniques in robotics.
