I'm a postodoctoral researcher at the [Dynamic Legged Systems Lab](https://dls.iit.it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.
 
My research interests are mainly focused on the combination of machine learning methods with classical control techniques for quadrupedal locomotion.

Here you can find some of my personal projects, mainly DIY robots!
