I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Dynamic Legged Systems Lab](https://dls.iit.it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. My research focuses on Machine Learning methods and Optimal Control for robot locomotion and manipulation. 

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pisa in 2016, followed by a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Sapienza University of Rome in 2018. I later began my PhD in Automatic Control, Bioengineering, and Operations Research, joining the DIAG Robotics Laboratory, and completed it in 2022.

I am passionate about open-source software/research, teaching, and collaborating with others. I’m always happy to connect—feel free to reach out!
