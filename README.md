I'm a researcher at the [Dynamic Legged Systems Lab](https://dls.iit.it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.
 
My research interests mainly focus on combining machine learning methods with classical control techniques for locomotion.

Here you can find some of my personal projects, mainly DIY robots!
